# Shopping List

This is a basic Shopping List app in which the user can add items, their quantity and category.

- The home screen shows the list of items added, which can be deleted on swiping.
- The items are stored on a backend realtime database hosted on Firebase.
- The video below showcases how addition and deletion of items affects the RTDB on Firebase.
